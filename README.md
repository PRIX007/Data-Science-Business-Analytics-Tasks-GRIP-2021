These are the tasks for Data Science and Business Analytics Intern@GRIP 2021

TASK 1@GRIP- Prediction using Supervised ML
● Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours. ● This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables. ● You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool ● Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data ● What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day? 

2)TASK 2@GRIP- Prediction using Unsupervised ML

● From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually. ● Use R or Python or perform this task ● Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox 

3)TASK 6@GRIP Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

● Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. ● The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly. ● Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox
